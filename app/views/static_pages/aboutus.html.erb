								<p>Hi, it's really nice of you to show interest in knowing us better!</p>
								<p>Sharingdais.com is an online peer-to-peer marketplace. The company is conceptualized and
								 promoted by a group of IIM graduates with the dream of connecting every household through

								initial phase, Sharingdais is focused on the market of Bangalore and Delhi & NCR.

								<strong>What is Sharing Economy?</strong> 
								Sharing Economy or Peer-to-Peer Economy or Collaborative Economy or Collaborative Consumption
								is a Socio-Economic system built around the sharing of human and physical assets. In simple 
								words, it is a concept that highlights the ability for individuals to rent or borrow goods 
								rather than buy and own them.
