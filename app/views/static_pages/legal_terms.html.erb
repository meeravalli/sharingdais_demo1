      <p>We may review, scan, or analyze your communications with other users exchanged via the Platform for fraud prevention, risk assessment, regulatory compliance, investigation, product development, research and customer support purposes.

This helps to prevent fraudulent actors from asking Guests to send them money outside of the Platform, such as by bank transfer or other money transfer methods. We may also scan, review or analyze messages for research and product development purposes to help make search, booking and user communications more efficient and effective, as well as to debug product offerings.</p>

However, from time to time we may have to manually review some communications. By using the Platform, you consent that Sharingdais, in its sole discretion, may review, scan, analyze, and store your communications, whether done manually or through automated means.</p>

      <b>Referral service and requesting for references</b><br>
      <p>The Platform provides a referral service that allows you to invite your friends and contacts to use the Platform. The Platform also allows you to ask your friends and contacts to write a reference for you, to be published on your Sharingdais profile.</p>
      <p>We may integrate the Platform with third party sites such as Facebook, so that you can send invitation messages or requests for references via the third party site itself.

      <p>You may also send invitation/request emails via the Platform itself, in which case we will ask you for the email addresses to send these emails to. You can type in the email addresses manually, or you can request Sharingdais to import the contacts in your email account address book(s). In both cases, we will use the information sent to us for the sole purpose of sending your friends and contacts a one-time email, inviting him or her to visit the Platform or to write a reference for you. With respect to referrals, we will also store the email addresses of your invitees to track if your friend joins Sharingdais in response to your referral.</p>
      <p>If you request us to import your contacts, we will collect, but not store, the username and password for the email account you wish to import your contacts from. We will use this information only for the purpose of importing your contacts.</p>
      <h2>Groups</h2>
      <p>The Platform may allow registered account holders to participate in online discussion forums (<b>"Group(s)”</b>) in selected cities.</p>
      <p>If you join a Group, then your membership in the Group as well as some of your public information (such as your profile picture and public profile page) will be visible to users who browse the Group. If you publish postings in a Group, then your postings will be visible to such users as well. The ability to browse the Group will depend on the Group settings, and it may or may not be limited to members of that Group.</p>

      <p>It’s important that you review the changed Privacy Policy.

      <p>Your browser may allow you to set how it handles cookies, such as declining all cookies or prompting you to decide whether to accept each cookie. But please note that some parts of the Platform may not work as intended or may not work at all without cookies.</p>
      <h2>Sharingdais cookies and third party cookies</h2>
      <p>Sharingdais may place our cookies on your device via the Platform. Accordingly, our Privacy Policy will apply to our treatment of the information we obtain via our cookies.</p>
      <p>We may also allow our business partners to place cookies on your device. For example, we use Google Analytics for web analytics, and so Google may also set cookies on your device. As further explained below, third parties may also place cookies on your device for advertising purposes.</p>
      <p>There are two types of cookies used on the Platform, namely <b>“persistent cookies”</b> and <b>“session cookies”</b>.</p>
      <p>Session cookies will normally expire when you close your browser, while persistent cookies will remain on your device after you close your browser, and can be used again the next time you access the Platform.</p>
      <h2>Other technologies</h2>
      <p>The Platform may also use other technologies with similar functionality to cookies, such as web beacons and tracking URLs to obtain Log Data about users. We may also use web beacons and tracking URLs in our messages to you to determine whether you have opened a certain message or accessed a certain link.</p>
      <h2>Uses for Sharingdais cookies</h2>
      <p>Sharingdais uses cookies for a number of purposes, such as the following: 
        <ol>
          <li>to enable, facilitate and streamline the functioning of the Platform across different webpages and browser sessions.</li>
          <li>to simplify your access to and use of the Platform and make it more seamless.</li>
          <li>to monitor and analyze the performance, operation and effectiveness of the Platform, so that we can improve and optimize it.</li>
          <li>to show you content (which may include advertisements) that is more relevant to you.</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <h2>Uses for third party cookies</h2>
      <p>Our partners’ cookies are intended to obtain information to help them provide services to Sharingdais. For example, third party companies and individuals we engage to provide services to us may track your behavior on our Platform to market and advertise Sharingdais listings or services to you on the Platform and third party websites. Third parties that use cookies and other tracking technologies to deliver targeted advertisements on our Platform and/or third party websites may offer you a way to prevent such targeted advertisements by opting-out at the websites of industry groups such as the Network Advertising Initiative (<a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/">http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/</a>) and/or the Digital Advertising Alliance (<a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/">http://www.aboutads.info/choices/</a>). You may also be able to control advertising cookies provided by publishers, for example Google’s Ad Preference Manager (<a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/">https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/</a>). Please note that even if you choose to opt-out of receiving targeted advertising, you may still receive advertising on the Platform – it just will not be tailored to your interests.</p>
      <p>In addition, Facebook places a cookie via the Platform that allows Facebook to obtain aggregated, non-Personal Information to optimize their services. For example, if a user clicks on an advertisement for the Sharingdais mobile app on Facebook and subsequently installs the app, this cookie will inform Facebook that a user (who is not personally identified) has installed the app after clicking on the advertisement. This cookie may also inform Facebook that a user is using the app, without identifying the specific actions taken by the user in the app.</p>
      <h2>Disabling Cookies</h2>
      <p>Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can modify your browser setting to decline cookies by visiting the Help portion of your browser’s toolbar. If you choose to decline cookies, please note that you may not be able to sign in, customize, or use some of the interactive features of the Platform. Flash cookies operate differently than browser cookies, and cookie management tools available in a web browser will not remove flash cookies. To learn more about how to manage flash cookies, you can visit the Adobe website (<a href="http://www.adobe.com/">http://www.adobe.com/</a>) and make changes at the Global Privacy Settings Panel (<a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager02.html">http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager02.html</a>)</p>
      <h2>Changes to this Cookie Policy</h2>
      <p>We can change this Cookie Policy at any time. If we make material changes to the Cookie Policy, we will let you know either by posting the changed Cookie Policy on the Platform or by sending you an email.</p>
      <p>It’s important that you review the changed Cookie Policy. If you do not wish to agree to the changed Cookie Policy, then we cannot continue to provide the Platform to you, and your only option is to stop accessing the Platform and deactivate your Sharingdais account. </p>
