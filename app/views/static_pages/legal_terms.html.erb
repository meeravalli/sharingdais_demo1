                        The Platform provides a  referral service that allows you to invite your friends and contacts to use the  Platform. The Platform also allows you to ask your friends and contacts to  write a reference for you, to be published on your Sharingdais profile.<br>
                        We may integrate the  Platform with third party sites such as Facebook, so that you can send  invitation messages or requests for references via the third party site itself.  These messages will be sent by the third party site, and Sharingdais does not  collect or retain the contact information that is used to send them.<br>
                        You may also send  invitation/request emails via the Platform itself, in which case we will ask  you for the email addresses to send these emails to. You can type in the email  addresses manually, or you can request Sharingdais to import the contacts in  your email account address book(s). In both cases, we will use the information  sent to us for the sole purpose of sending your friends and contacts a one-time  email, inviting him or her to visit the Platform or to write a reference for  you. With respect to referrals, we will also store the email addresses of your  invitees to track if your friend joins Sharingdais in response to your  referral.<br>
                        If you request us to  import your contacts, we will collect, but not store, the username and password  for the email account you wish to import your contacts from. We will use this  information only for the purpose of importing your contacts.</p>

                        It&rsquo;s important that you  review the changed Privacy Policy. If you do not wish to agree to the changed  Privacy Policy, then we will not be able to continue providing the Platform to  you, and your only option will be to stop accessing the Platform and deactivate  your Sharingdais account. </p>

                        We may also allow our  business partners to place cookies on your device.

                      <ol>
